				The role of the <i class="graphic-designer">graphic designer</i> is to create an effective visual language that can be communicated to viewers. It is similar to creating a diamond ring from an unearthed diamond in the rough. Although one begins with an uncut stone, it is eventually crafted into a visually arresting piece of refined jewelry while retaining the appearance and essence of a stone. The question is: how does one make a beautiful diamond ring? How does one make beautiful designs while also preserving the essence of the original material? This is a question that graphic designers seek to answer. 
				<br><br>
				In order to examine the notion of "nothingness" as a possible term for the involvement of the designer, I intend to explore artists from Russian Constructivism to contemporary graphic designers such as Kazimir Malevich, Piet Mondriaan, Laszlo moholy-Nagy, Experimental Jetset, and Sang-Soo Ann. The graphic designers mentioned above best exemplify the concept of "nothingness" in regards to the involvement of the designer. 
				<br><br>
				Along with the artists, I intend to examine Taoism, the theory of Less is More, the essence of form, function, and content, proper composition and pure color, mathematical grids, and neutrality. Moreover, I would like to dig into the idea of nothingness as an approach of minimizing involvement, and how it can be applied conceptually to graphic design. 
				<br><br>
				The topics I delivered are the fundamental elements of minimizing the involvement of the designers, while maximizing the effect. This can be applied to current graphic design practices. Through this essay, I will attempt to alter perspectives and consider nothingness as the backbone of design, which is the most valuable part of design.

		<div id="introduction">	
			<p id="title"><b>Introduction</b></p>
				<br>	
				<span>
					From the inception of the Universe, everything under the sun has been created as existence. Although existence occurred from seemingly nowhere, and the genesis of creation may still remain an enigma, the evolution of existence has been gradually being unveiled before us. Such knowledge has been unraveling before us despite being uncertain of the origin of all creation. This leads to ontological pondering such as what originated first; the chicken or the egg? In what capacity did they exist before its creation? The contemplation of creation eventually spawned questions with broader implications. It also had a profound influence on the notion of ‘nothingness’, which is inextricably linked to existence. The recognition of nothingness is not prevalently discussed, but occupies a very important position in our lives. 
					<br><br>
					This notion of ‘nothingness’ can be found in graphic design as well. The fact that we are confronted with endless alternatives in graphic design has provoked deep reflection of ‘nothingness’ in design. The concept and form of ‘nothingness’ in graphic design is an interesting theme because it stimulates a detailed exploration of the essence of creation. Moreover, it is an important element of graphic design when considering fundamental shape and color, the essence of content and element etc.
					<br><br>
					The following thesis introduces the research question: How can ‘nothingness’ be applied as a concept in graphic design? This research question examines the investigation of the connectivity between ‘nothingness. ’ or 'minimizing designer involvement’ in graphic design. It challenges the reader to accept ‘nothingness,’ or ‘minimizing designer’s involvement’ as a new graphic design principle. Therefore the thesis introduces fundamental possibilities of minimizing the involvement of the designer through the timeline of graphic design history. 
					<br><br>
					This thesis has been assembled into two chapters, introducing the idea that ‘minimizing the involvement of the designer’ is a new graphic design principle of ‘nothingness’.
				</span>	

				<br><br>

				<span>
				The first chapter contains three sections:
				</span>

				<br><br>

				<div id="minidiv1"> 
					02-1: Understanding terms of ‘nothingness’ and ‘existence’
				</div>

				<div id="minidiv1"> 
					02-2: Contrasting perspectives on the eastern and western notion of ‘nothingness’
				</div>

				<div id="minidiv1"> 
					02-3: Declaring a new perspective on ‘nothingness’
				</div>

				<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

				<span>
					The second chapter consists of five sections, showing chronological examples of minimized involvement of designers in graphic design history. 
				</span>

				<br><br>

				<div id="minidiv">
					&#8718; The first section in the first chapter introduces a brief definition of the term of ‘nothingness’ and ‘existence’ that will facilitate the reader to understand its exact meaning. 
				</div>

				<br><br>

				<div id="minidiv">
					&#8718; Next, there will be a juxtaposition on the eastern and western perspective of ‘nothingness’ by crystallizing the definition and presenting examples in the next section.
				</div>

				<br><br>

				<div id="minidiv">
					&#8718; The final section of the first chapter consists of presenting the new perspective of nothingness as following: ‘By minimizing the involvement of the graphic designer, a state of harmony could be achieved’.   

				<span>
					In the second chapter, the aforementioned new perspective will be applied to graphic design. 
				</span>

				<div id="minidiv">
					&#8718; The example of using form and function through Kazimir Malevich and El Lissitzky who were in the Suprematist movement will be examined in the first section. 
				</div>

				<br><br>

				<div id="minidiv">
					&#8718; Moreover, the geometrical shape and pure color will be the fundamental aspect of minimizing the involvement of the designer in the second section embodied by graphic designers such as Piet Mondriaan, Theo van Doesburg, and Vilmos Huszár. 
				</div>

				<br><br>

				<div id="minidiv">
					&#8718; In the third section, Bauhaus and the new typography will be used as examples to show the essence of content as demonstrated by Joost Schmidt, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, and Herbert Bayer. 
				</div>

				<br><br>

				<div id="minidiv">
					&#8718; Systematic grids are introduced in the next section. such as Josef Müller-Brockmann’s poster series at the Zurich Tonhalle and Emil Ruder’s systematic grid structure based work. 
				</div>

				<br><br>

				<div id="minidiv">
					&#8718; Finally, the fifth section will examine neutrality as the last fundamental principle of minimizing the involvement of the designer by showing the Experimental Jetset’s idea of Helveticanism and the typeface called ‘Ann sang-soo’.

					The definition of ‘existence’ and ‘nothingness’ will be thoroughly explained in this chapter. Based on the definitions, mentioned in this chapter, I will define the Western and the Eastern notion of nothingness in the next chapter. Furthermore, I will examine how differently the definitions can be translated depending on its perspective.


					2.1.1 What is Existence?



					When I consider the concept of existence, I mention this poem. It illustrates the relationship between existence and nonexistence. This poem suggests that, ‘No Cat’ can also be an existence in the context of this poem. There are many controversial theories about the definition of ‘Existence’, because many people have conflicting views on its definition. This concept has not always been very clearly distinguishable because it is difficult to define this word. 

					According to Dictionary.com, ‘existence’ means: ‘The state or fact of existing.’ It always has to do with being 2. In general, existence is mostly translated to: independent of one’s presence. In other words, it is defined as ‘ the state of having objective reality’. From the philosophical discussion of the notion of existence, or being, it is also related with ontology: the branch of metaphysics dealing with the nature of being. 

					2.1.2 What is Nothingness?



					Before I start with this chapter, I, myself am questioning how ‘existence’ and ‘nonexistence’ are related to each other. Is ‘nonexistence’ the same as ‘nothingness’? How can we describe ‘nothingness’? Where is ‘nothingness’? Does ‘nothingness’ exist?
					If yes, in what form does ‘nothingness’ exist? In order to solve these questions, I have thoroughly researched ‘nothingness’.
					The idea of ‘nothingness’, which could be defined as an empty space, is very broad to define. Therefore, I am convinced that it is necessary for everyone to be aware of the multiple definitions of ‘nothingness’, because everyone has experienced ‘nothingness’ at least once in their lifetime. The definition of ‘nothingness’ seems very powerless and meaningless. However, it has various possible meanings behind it. Therefore, I have to admit that it is an interesting term to research.

					To understand the term ‘nothingness’ more clearly, 4 multiple definitions are supplied below:

					1. The state of being nothing, 
					2. Something that is nonexistent, 
					3. Lack of being; nonexistence, 
					4. Unconsciousness or death, 
					5. Utter insignificance, emptiness, or worthlessness, 
					6. Something insignificant or without value.  

					As demonstrated, one can say that ‘nothingness’ means literally nothing. The other can say that it has a different meaning depending on its situation. However, if I would have to define ‘nothingness’ with a few words, I would define it as follows: it literally means nothing. It could also mean indifference, nihility, invisibility and etc. It can also be a state of ‘white’ or ‘black’, because most people consider that white or black space has nothing in it. 

					From the graphic design point of view, ‘nothingness’ could be a plain screen, surface, paper and so on. It can be translated as a white space, which is one of the important aspects of the graphic design. However it can be a self-imposed limited involvement that the designer sets for oneself.
